Rasp Pi Config Files and LCD Drives Center

This is the complete downloads center for your LCD display drivers. Keep these folders as separate
folders. Do not remove or place these files from their folders; they must remain within their individual
folders at all times. After you download these two folders, simply place them within your Raspberry Pi
Python programs folder of choice. I use my Rasp Pi documents folder for all my Rasp Pi Python programs,
which I also keep in their separate folders, within my documents folder. You can keep these two folders
outside your other Python programs folders, but they must stay where you had placed your Python programs
folders. I use my Rasp Pi documents folder for all my other Python programs folders. So keep these two
Rasp Pi config files folder and LCD drivers within the documents folder or folder of choice where you had
stored all your other Python programs. I keep all my Rasp pi Python programs inside folders to keep them
neat and organized. Note: if you don't keep these two file folders inside the same place you place your
Rasp Pi Python program files, these Python files will not be able to make your LCD display work.
